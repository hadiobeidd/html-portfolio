<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Hadi Obeid, a driven computer science student from Lebanon. I rank in the top 15 of my class despite facing significant personal and financial challenges.<br/> As the president of my university's Human Rights Club, I won an award for leading the most creative club.<br/> I am also the founder of an academy in South Lebanon aimed at teaching programming, with aspirations to expand nationally and globally.

  I am passionate about integrating technology into education and promoting human rights, aiming to make programming accessible to all. My ultimate goal is to open my own software company specializing in website and mobile application development. Currently, I am enhancing my skills by completing a comprehensive web development course on Udemy and preparing for an internship interview at Cedars Software Solutions.</p>
